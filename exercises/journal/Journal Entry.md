This is just the draft of a longer explication of the last ten years.

Look mom, I really appraciate how you have changed and become more understaing of my very real struggle with depression and anxiety. That being said, I think we leave a bit too much unsaid. I think we both have the habit of avoiding the issue and this is a clear example of this. I am struggling with a particularly bad depressive episode, triggered in part by the stress of my recent move to nashville and the stress of starting a coding school where there is real pressure to perform at peak performance. That being said, we have focused on a number of things that, while important to sleep, do not change the underlying situations that are causing my depression. I am not suggesting that I think it would be best for me to quit coding school. Let's be clear. This still remains a very good opportunity for me, provided I can take full advantage of it.

That being said, I am strugglingl on a daily basis to do just that. It is a good thing that I transfered back to my original cohort, this gives me a minute to catch my breath and catch up on some of the core concepts that my previous classmates began the earlier cohort with. The better part of my mornings is just getting over the hump of depression that I wake up with. Make no mistake, I am trying to work with my psychiatrists and doctors to sort this out, but in the meantime I am still struggling. It has only been

/* FROM SOME UNKNOWN DAY AROUND THESE DATES */
This is the first day that I can say it might work out well in the end. Of course there is always death. That much is unavoidable. Nevertheless there is much that can be said for the workings of antidepressants. I know that I write this out of a personal sense of dishonesty. However, I still have things to say. I don't know. Delicioius Tacos has stuff to say. But then again he is out living his desperate life of not-so-quiet debaucherous humblebrag.

Written the next day
12/13
Sleep continues to deteriorate from the high of the previous days's good sleep. Woke in the middle of the night and had to call the hotline. I felt better after she reccomended that I find an insomnia support group. I think I was able to go back to sleep. But, I never woke refreshed. Much of this morning has already been wasted worrying about this.



Later the same day,

I was feeling terrible in the am (11:00-2:00pm) but now I feel fine. I think it might be the melatonin that is making the depression worse. I will try one night without it.

The more I think about solving my insomnia the more I don't want to live. I guess the thing to do is to focus on things that I can change, which are many. Also, it is likely that my insomnia is depression related and that is treatable. Treat the depression: potentialy treat the insomnia.

I spoke with my psychiatrist today and he has given me a script for amytriptaline. Supposed to help with sleep. We'll see. I think I might try some of the belsomra.

12-18-16
Chris came to visit today. It was good to see him but I had a bad day this afternoon, another dark moment.

12-19-16
Chris is stil here. Had my interview today. It went wellish.
I have not got as much work done as I might have done otherwise, but it was nice to have him here, if only for a few days. Now it is very cold in Nashville. My sleep has been not bad if not great, the belsomra and the mirtazepine with the grapefruit juic nightly has been quite useful. I do not know if it will continue to work but if it begins to fail I have the amytriptaline to try as an adjunct.

12-20-16
Chris is still here. He kind of needs to leave. My roommates are beginning to wonder why he is still here.  It is becoming sort of uncomfortable. I also went home for a meeting with my psychiatrist.

12-21-16
Today is the winter solstice. I finally slept for what felt like a reasonalbe length of time with the combination of mirtazepine, belsomra, and 6 oz of grapefruit juice. Yet, it should be noted, I was tired throughout the day at various points. It is not clear to me why this is the case. Whether it was due to the drugs or some sort of disruption while sleeping is unclear.
12-22-16
Did not wake feeling refreshed as I did yesterday. Though I did take 2 5mg time release doses of melatonin with the normal coctail of mirt. and bels. with 6oz grapefruit juice. Also, this time the grapefruit juice was not fresh squeezed, which may have been less effective. Also, the bedroom environment could use some work. I have mounds of laundry to do and I need to make my bed so that it feels more official. All of this stuff is eminently within the realm of my control.
Today has been marked by several moments of deep sadness and loneliness.
12-23-16
Last nights sleep was interrupted at 5:45 but I was able to return to sleep until 8:30. Suffice it to say, I now feel refreshed. I did not use the melatonin last night, nor did I drink any alcohol or caffeine the whole day. Grapefruit juice, mirtazepine, and belsomra 15mg were all taken at 9:30. I can tell this day is going to be good.

**12-24-16**
Sleep was not as good as I might have hoped, but there is still much I can do to improve it. Perhaps I did not drink as much grapefruit juice as I should have (i.e. less than 6oz, the standard dose). I did take the 20mg of belsomra, but its effectiveness appears to be less than it used to be. That said I am not quite sure whetehr I am sleeping the correct ammount.
12-25-16
Sleep continues to be sub-excellent on a daily basis. Possible sources are the bed itself, which is not as comfy as Sophie's bed in Chattanooga and possibly not as warm either. I remember waking up at 5:45 feeling like I needed another blanket on me. This can be rectified. So can the bed surface which I can add the mattress topper that I brought and is in the closet.

So far it has been good. There was only one brief moment

visiting for Christmas
12/27/16
Returned home for Hannukah. We had a decent time last night.
Everything was fine until I was about to eat dinner with them tonight. Sophie and I got into it and I left early for Nashville.
12/28/16
Slept ok last night. Still don't feel particularly good when waking up. Some sort of residual feelings of depression. Though, once I manage to get going I feel pretty ok. Never great. Sometimes good.
12/29/16
Sleep was it's usual affair of not bad but not especially good. It should be noted that I drank some green tea yesterday.
12/30/16
Slept very good after working out the day before. However, I was still awoken by my alarm at 7:00 and my phone playing the BBC radio earlier in the night. Those things can be fixed. Otherwise sleep and mood have improved remarkablly in the past few weeks. This is a cool font that I have now changed my system font to.
12/31/16
Woke at 7am to my alarm. Dreadful thoughts about the totality of existential threat to the individual, me, plagued my mind. I was unable to go back to sleep as usual. These thoughts persisted into the morning hours as I lay in bed desperatly trying to avoid such thoughts again. They were the kind that made the entire endeavor of life seem not worthwhile, but death so terrible an idea that I did not want to continue. Stuck in the middle of this existential quandry. The effecs during the day are limited but as soon as I returned to the bed I experienced deep feelings of distress.
1/4/17
Well as soon as I started my class again, my sleep markedly deteriorated.
1/6/17
Sleep improved onece I increased my belsomra dosage two nights ago to 30 mg, despite not having enough to justify this dosage.
1/8/17
My mood continues to deteriorate even as my sleep improves, or rather, in direct proportion to it's improvement. The better I sleep, the less tired I am, the worse I feel. I worked out and the soreness from my muscles kept me from sleeping properly. This actually caused an improvment in my mood.
