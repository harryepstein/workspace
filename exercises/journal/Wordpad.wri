This is the first time I have written about my shits. The difficulty in fully describing them lies in their nearly complete inconsequence and regularity; I have never had any real problems (apart from some blood the stool which, though my hypochondriac tendencies suggested otherwise, was really just the side effect of a bad case of hemeroids: "Alas no bowel cancer," bemoaned my morbid anxieties). Which, as a metaphor for my life, everything has come out smoothly if inconsequentially, which, I am only beginning to appreciate is a problem. It's a problem because, whether or not you realize it, I had dreams and plans for my life, plans which required specifc action plans and executions for their reification. I always knew I wanted to be a musician. Drummer, electronic musician, maybe a bit of guitar if I could ever get good enough on that. But, while I was mucking about floundering to get a degree from a third rate college, time was running away, time was running out. Now, I find myself, approaching the precipice of 30, with my dreams haning in a precarious balance. Yes, I have plans to go to coding school. I don't love coding, but the benefits are too great to pass up. The potential job security, the money which will allow me to pursue these musical ambitions. Though, the more I think about it, the more I think I am making some fundamental trade off. Does pursuing coding necessitate an abandonment of my musical dreams: I really think it does. Then again, the possiblity of a musical career, at this point, is practically impossible for a number of reasons. The only reason coding was chosen was due to the fact that the money it would provide would at least allow me to indulge in the continued fantasy of such a dream. But that's not what I really want: I don't want the fantasy of a dream; I want the dream itself. Though, more than the dream itself, at this point in my life, I want to be able to point to better times in the future and some sort of stake in the world of the future. That is what coding allows. It's really not that bad of a job. It is full of solving somewhat meainingless problems. Building abstractions in the machine. But, you can do some cool things with computers. And, isn't that what coding was all about in the first place. Doing cool things. It's the only job where you really get to make things that can change the world. It is the ultimate product of capitalism. It is no longer a phyisical object; it's the digital abstraction of an object. Its an abstraction of an abstraction.
Maybe I'll get an omlette this morning. That is kind of what I am craving. 
I've had a terrible run these last few days. The anxiety, which I was doing my darndest to ignore, came back with a vengance. And, then it occurred to me that I had completedly abandoned the plan that my doctor and I had agreed upon. Such a revelation, combined with the immediate results that I saw as a result of resuming the medication, was relief sublime. After even one day, I found myself able to do the things that had plagued me for days before. Even now I am feeling the warm embrace of the clonazepam and buspar. Once I get that omlette in me, I will be feeling even better. 
	On a separate note, I need to get a job of sorts because I really don't want to have to ask my parents to give me any money: I'm not sure that they will this time. This last time really seemed like the last time. 
	However, if I apply to other bootcamp programs and get in at least one, I think they will continue to support me. 
	This has been a difficult period, but I am beginning to see the light at the end of tunnel, or at least the possiblity of light, to be a bit more pessimistic.
